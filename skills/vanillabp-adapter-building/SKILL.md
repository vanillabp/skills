# Building a VanillaBP Adapter (Version 2)

*Last checked against `UPGRADE.md` entries up to 2026-08-28. A story which changes behaviour re-reads this skill and moves the date.*

Read `vanillabp-concepts` (architecture, glossary) and `vanillabp-bpms-characteristics`
(per-BPMS traits) first. This skill covers the mechanics common to all adapters.

## Repositories and workspace conventions

- Each adapter is an **own Git repository**, cloned as a sibling of
  `adapter-platform-integration` in the workspace root. Initialize with
  `git init -b main`.
- The Camunda adapter repos will later **replace `main` of the existing GitHub repos**
  `vanillabp/camunda7-adapter` and `vanillabp/camunda8-adapter` (Camunda Community
  Hub; not under our control, no new repos possible there). Therefore: directory and
  artifact names must match those repos, and the Version-1 groupId
  `org.camunda.community.vanillabp` is kept.
- The Process-Engine-API adapter is a new repo (`process-engine-api-adapter`),
  groupId `io.vanillabp`.
- All adapter artifacts are versioned **2.0.0-SNAPSHOT** (aligned with
  adapter-platform-integration).
- After creating a new adapter repo, add it to the repository list in the workspace's
  `CLAUDE.md`.

## Module layout (mirror of the platform split)

```
<adapter-repo>/
  pom.xml                  parent (packaging pom)
  core/                    platform-neutral: SPI implementations + BPMS client logic
  spring-boot/             Spring Boot auto-configuration (thin glue only)
  quarkus/
    runtime/               Quarkus extension runtime (producers, quarkus-extension.yaml)
    deployment/            Quarkus extension deployment (build steps)
```

Rules:

- **`core` is plain Java** — no Spring/Quarkus imports. It depends on
  `io.vanillabp.adapter:migration-adapter-spi` (adapter SPI),
  `io.vanillabp:vanillabp-integration-spi` (business SPI, transitively) and the BPMS
  client/engine artifact. All real behavior lives here.
- Platform modules only *construct and register* the core objects: read
  configuration, create beans. If you write BPMS logic in a platform module, move it
  to `core`.
- Camunda 7 has more modules than the layout above, not fewer: `core/`,
  `spring-boot/`, `spring-boot-webapps/` (Cockpit, Tasklist and Admin, which are a
  Spring servlet application and therefore Spring Boot only) and `quarkus/`, whose
  extension runs in JVM mode only - the engine stack is reflection-heavy and Camunda
  never supported native images.

## Dependencies (local Maven repo — build order matters)

```
io.vanillabp:spi-for-java:1.2.0-SNAPSHOT                     (user-facing annotations)
io.vanillabp:vanillabp-integration-spi:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT        (business SPI)
io.vanillabp.adapter:migration-adapter-spi:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT    (adapter SPI)
io.vanillabp:vanillabp-spring-boot-integration:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT   (spring-boot module)
io.vanillabp:vanillabp-quarkus-integration:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT       (quarkus runtime module)
io.vanillabp:vanillabp-quarkus-integration-deployment:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT (quarkus deployment module)
```

Build order: `spi-for-java` → `adapter-platform-integration` (`./mvnw install`) →
adapter repos (`mvn install`). `install` alone: it already runs every phase `verify`
has, and naming both compiles every module twice. Copy the Spotless setup
(`formatting_conventions.xml` + plugin config) from adapter-platform-integration so
formatting rules are identical.

## Adapter SPI to implement (in `core`)

Package `io.vanillabp.integration.adapter.spi` unless noted:

1. `AdapterDeploymentService<BPMN, PC> extends ExtensionWiringService<BPMN, PC>` —
   one instance **per configured adapter id** (not per type!):
   - `getAdapterId()` / `getAdapterType()` — id from configuration, type is a
     constant (e.g. `"camunda7"`).
   - `getModelType()` / `getProcessContextType()` — the adapter's BPMN model class
     and its processing-context class (an adapter-own accumulator, threaded through
     the pipeline).
   - Pipeline, called by the core `DeploymentService` per workflow module:
     `readBpmn(moduleId, filename, inputStream, isVanillaBpBpmn)` → list of
     (bpmnProcessId → model) entries (one BPMN file may contain several processes;
     throw `BpmnParseException` on parse errors) →
     `prepareBpmn(moduleId, existingContext, filename, bpmnProcessId, model)` →
     `wireBpmn(moduleId, filename, bpmnProcessId, model, context)` →
     `deployResources(moduleId, context)` →
     `startWorkflowProcessing(moduleId, context)` /
     `stopWorkflowProcessing(moduleId, context)` (graceful shutdown, reverse order).
1b. `WorkflowTaskWiring` — what you call back into the core WHILE YOU DEPLOY, and
   `WorkflowTaskInvoker` — what your worker threads call at runtime. Both are implemented by the
   same core object, so you take the wiring type in your deployment service and the invoker type in
   your handlers. `validateNoUnwiredWorkflowTaskMethods` and `resolveProcessVersions` are NOT yours
   to call: the core runs them once your module finished deploying. `registerDeployedVersion` is,
   because only you know the version your BPMS ended up with.
1c. `AdapterCollaborators` — you do not ask for those two, or for any other collaborator,
   one at a time. The platform builds ONE object and your constructor takes it. Mandatory
   in it: `WorkflowTaskWiring`, `WorkflowTaskInvoker`, `NameClashAvoidanceSupport`,
   `WorkflowAggregateSync`, `PreCommitRegistrar` — a set without one of them throws, naming
   your adapter id. Optional (`Optional<...>`, and you have to work without them):
   `WorkflowEndedInvoker` and `BpmsInitiatedStartInvoker`; an adapter built without one gets a
   WARN naming it. Never take a collaborator by setter: that is what let an adapter deploy, run
   tasks and never report a workflow end while nothing failed (decision 28). What YOU resolve
   from your own configuration — job timeout, retry backoff, fetched variables — and what your
   own extension contributes stay your own constructor arguments.
2. `MigratableProcessService<A>` — the per-adapter runtime the core
   `MigrationProcessService` delegates to:
   - `getAdapterId()`
   - `startWorkflowPhaseOne(aggregatePersistence, aggregate)` — inside the local
     transaction, and it only ASKS: phase one asks, phase two acts, for every adapter.
     Starting is the degenerate case where there is nothing to ask about.
   - `startWorkflowPhaseTwo(workflowAggregateId)` — after commit, dispatched via
     outbox → core-owned `PhaseTwoRouter` → `MigrationProcessService` (uses the
     adapter ID persisted with the outbox entry — no re-election). Must be
     idempotent (key: moduleId + bpmnProcessId + aggregateId).
   - `awarenessOfWorkflow(aggregatePersistence, aggregateId)` /
     `awarenessOfTask(aggregateId, taskId)` — return `WorkflowAwareness`;
     `BPMS_UNAVAILABLE` only for infrastructure failures (it suppresses fallback
     election), `UNKNOWN_TO_BPMS` only after a *successful* query found nothing.
     The workflow probe gets the persistence because the aggregate-ID VARIABLE is
     named after the aggregate's ID attribute — derive that name from the
     persistence of the call at hand, NEVER remember it between calls: the election
     runs before every other SPI method, so a remembered name is the one of
     whichever aggregate came last - a defect Camunda 8 actually had.
   - `workflowVisibilityDelay()` (optional, `default` = none) — how long an
     `UNKNOWN_TO_BPMS` of this BPMS may still turn into `ACTIVE`. Report a window
     where the probe reads an eventually consistent model; the core waits it out
     only while probing an adapter its `WorkflowAdapterCache` names for that
     workflow, so an unknown workflow keeps failing fast.
   - Inbound contexts (`TaskInvocationContext`, `WorkflowEndedContext`,
     `BpmsInitiatedStartContext`) should answer `getAdapterId()` (`default` null):
     a delivery proves which BPMS holds the workflow, and the core records it.
   - `deliversTasksAtLeastOnce()` (`default` false) plus
     `TaskInvocationContext.getDeliveryId()` (`default` null) — a BPMS which
     may hand the same task out again names each delivery by something STABLE across
     redeliveries and DIFFERENT for a new task instance (C8 job key, PEA task id; a
     user-task listener uses the listener job, not the user-task key: creation and
     cancellation of one task would otherwise share a key). The core writes a record in
     the handler's transaction and answers a repeated delivery from it. An engine
     delivering inside the application's transaction reports neither and keeps today's
     behaviour, documented as a decision rather than a gap (Camunda 7).
   - `correlateMessagePhaseTwo` has a seven-argument overload taking the ACTIVATION which
     planned the correlation; its `default` forwards to the six-argument one, which stays
     the method to implement. Override it where your BPMS deduplicates messages in a net of
     its own (Camunda 8 derives a `messageId`): without the activation in that derivation,
     three elements of a multi-instance call activity reach the outbox as three operations
     and your BPMS as ONE message, and VanillaBP cannot fix that from its side. The value
     arrives with the entry because phase two runs on the dispatcher's thread.
   - `TaskInvocationContext.getActivationId()` (`default` null) — what the BPMS calls the
     ELEMENT INSTANCE which is running (C8 element instance key, C7 activity instance id,
     PEA task id). **It is not the delivery id under a second name, and answering it with
     the delivery id is only right where the BPMS happens to name deliveries after element
     instances.** The two contracts are opposite: a delivery id has to stay EQUAL while the
     BPMS repeats itself, an activation id has to DIFFER between two activations of one
     element and says nothing about redeliveries. An adapter which reports no delivery id
     can still report this one — Camunda 7 delivers inside its own transaction and knows
     its activity instance perfectly well. The core puts it into the idempotency key of a
     message correlation planned while the handler runs, which is what keeps the elements
     of a multi-instance activity from sharing one key. Reporting nothing is allowed and
     costs exactly that.

Skeleton stage: methods that are not implemented yet throw
`UnsupportedOperationException("<method> is implemented in a later story")` — never
silently do nothing (silent stubs hide wiring bugs in later stories).

## Registration: Spring Boot (template: dummy adapter)

Template to study:
`adapter-platform-integration/spring-boot-integration/integration-tests/dummy-adapter/`
— three auto-configuration classes listed in
`src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports`:

1. **Adapter announcement** — must be built *before* the platform validates
   configured adapter types:
   ```java
   @AutoConfiguration(before = SpringBootMigrationAdapterAutoConfiguration.class)
   public class Camunda7AdapterConfiguration extends AdapterConfigurationBase {
     public static final String ADAPTER_TYPE = "camunda7";
     @Override public String getAdapterType() { return ADAPTER_TYPE; }
   }
   ```
   (Do not declare other beans in this class — it must be constructible early.)
2. **Deployment service** — `@AutoConfiguration(after =
   SpringBootMigrationAdapterAutoConfiguration.class)`, registering the adapter's
   `AdapterDeploymentService` as an **individual element bean**. NEVER register a
   bean of type `List<AdapterDeploymentService<...>>` — Spring's collection
   injection only collects element beans, so List beans break as soon as a second
   adapter type is on the classpath (= the migration scenario). The platform collects
   all element beans via `ObjectProvider` streams. Register ONE element bean per
   configured adapter id of this adapter's type, named after that id - never a single
   instance for whichever id happens to come first.
3. **Process service** — an element bean of the adapter's
   `MigratableProcessService` implementation (the platform injects all of them into
   every `ProcessServiceSpringBean`). Same rule: element beans only. The election
   fails startup fast if any prioritized adapter id has no matching process
   service.

## Registration: Quarkus (template: dummy adapter)

Template:
`adapter-platform-integration/quarkus-integration/integration-tests/dummy-adapter/`
— an own Quarkus extension (runtime + deployment):

- `runtime/src/main/resources/META-INF/quarkus-extension.yaml` with
  `dependencies: [vanillabp]`.
- Deployment module build steps:
  - produce a `FeatureBuildItem`
  - produce `VanillaBpMigratableProcessServiceBuildItem.builder()
    .adapterType("...").migratableProcessServiceBeanClass(<runtime class name>)
    .build()` — announces the adapter type and its process-service bean to the
    VanillaBP extension.
  - register the runtime producer via `AdditionalBeanBuildItem`
    (`.setUnremovable()`).
- Runtime module: an `@ApplicationScoped` producer creating the core
  `MigratableProcessService` (resolve the adapter id from
  `MigrationAdapterProperties.getAdapters()` by type) and, later, the deployment
  services.

## Registration pitfalls (verified while building the C7/C8/PEA skeletons)

- **Configuration shape:** `vanillabp.adapters` binds to a
  `Map<String, AdapterConfigProperties>` in the CORE model (the tree is
  modeled once, in `MigrationAdapterProperties`; Spring binds the core POJOs
  directly, Quarkus maps its `@ConfigMapping` interface onto them via a generated
  MapStruct `toCore()`). The shorthand `vanillabp.adapters.<id>: <type>`
  does NOT bind — always use `vanillabp.adapters.<id>.type: <type>` (the adapter id
  is the map key, the type a sub-property). The id→type view is
  `MigrationAdapterProperties.adapterTypes()` (type defaults to the id).
- **Adapter config OVERLAY:** adapters contribute their
  own keys (connection settings etc.) to the SAME tree
  (`vanillabp.adapters.<id>.<key>` — never a parallel namespace) by binding an
  adapter-owned overlay of the `vanillabp` prefix:
  - Spring: a second `@ConfigurationProperties("vanillabp")` class in the adapter's
    spring-boot module (same-prefix classes coexist; unknown keys are ignored by
    JavaBean binding). Run the configuration processor for IDE metadata.
  - Quarkus: a RUN_TIME `@ConfigRoot @ConfigMapping(prefix = "vanillabp")` in the
    adapter's runtime module (reference: the platform's Quarkus dummy adapter,
    `DummyAdapterOverlayProperties`). The blanket
    `withMappingIgnore("vanillabp.**")` is GONE — a key no registered mapping
    knows fails the startup (typo detection; Quarkus is stricter than Spring,
    accepted). Therefore EVERY key an adapter reads/writes must be modeled in its
    overlay mapping.
  - **Adapter-id-set rule:** the authoritative id set is ALWAYS the
    platform's core properties (`adapterTypes()`); overlay maps are per-known-id
    lookups only, NEVER iterated to discover ids (Spring env-var overrides can
    materialize phantom map entries; overlay-only ids are invisible to
    validation).
- **Quarkus capability contract:** an adapter extension MUST declare, in its runtime
  `META-INF/quarkus-extension.yaml`, a provided capability
  `io.vanillabp.adapter.<adapterType>` (suffix EQUALS the adapter type, e.g.
  `io.vanillabp.adapter.camunda8`). The VanillaBP Quarkus integration hard-validates
  this — it is independent of the artifact groupId. The extension `name` can be
  anything (convention `vanillabp-<type>`).
- **Skeleton smoke tests / deployment lifecycle:** the core deployment runs
  unconditionally at context start — Spring's deployment `SmartLifecycle` (and the
  Quarkus `StartupEvent` path) call `deployResources`/`startWorkflowProcessing` for
  every (workflow module × prioritized adapter) **even with zero BPMN files**. A
  skeleton whose pipeline methods throw therefore cannot complete a full boot. Two
  proven ways to still test adapter *discovery*:
  - Spring: `@SpringBootTest` with
    `spring.autoconfigure.exclude=<the platform's DeploymentAutoConfiguration>`, or an
    `ApplicationContextRunner` that does not activate the deployment lifecycle; assert
    the deployment-service list bean and the `MigratableProcessService` bean resolve
    with the expected adapter id/type.
  - Quarkus: a skeleton that wires no deployment service boots fine (the JDBC outbox
    stays inactive without a datasource, so a two-phase adapter needs neither).
  A test also needs a `META-INF/workflow-module` marker — startup enforces "at least
  one workflow module".
- **Camunda 7 + Spring Boot 4:** `camunda-bpm-spring-boot-starter:7.24.0` targets
  Spring Boot 3.5.x (via `camunda-parent`) and is incompatible with the VanillaBP-2
  baseline (Boot 4.1). Depend on `org.camunda.bpm:camunda-engine` directly and wire
  the embedded engine yourself; do not fight the starter.

## C7-family portability rules (Operaton / CIB seven readiness)

The Camunda 7 adapter stays Camunda-7-only, but every line of it must stay **trivially
copyable** to the forks Operaton (`org.operaton.bpm.*`) and CIB seven
(`org.cibseven.bpm.*`) — both renamed all packages; the copy will be generated with
OpenRewrite later. Rules for ALL C7 adapter code:

- Write against `org.camunda.bpm` only; never mix in fork artifacts.
- Prefer **namespace-generic model-API reads** (`getAttributeValueNs(CAMUNDA_NS, ...)`
  with a single namespace constant) over typed extension getters — Operaton renamed
  those symbols (`getCamundaExpression()` → `getOperatonExpression()`), plain package
  renaming would not fix them.
- Keep engine access behind the adapter's own classes (no engine types leaking into
  shared/platform-neutral modules beyond the `BPMN` type parameter).
- Know the fork quirks for the later copy: CIB seven needs an explicit
  `com.fasterxml.uuid:java-uuid-generator` dependency (its FEEL engine does not pull it
  transitively); per-fork engine-spring artifacts (`operaton-engine-spring`,
  `cibseven-engine-spring-7`); fork Spring Boot baselines differ (Operaton 2.x = Boot 4,
  CIB seven ships a `-starter-4`).
- The whole C7 family is **JVM-mode only** on Quarkus (no native image) — decided.

## Configuration validation

Validate an adapter's configuration **at startup** for every configured adapter id of
its type (Spring auto-config / Quarkus startup), not lazily on first use, and emit
messages that tell the developer which property keys to add. An unconfigured adapter
should still let the app boot (guided, incremental setup). This is a VanillaBP core
concept — see the `vanillabp-config-validation` skill. (The current Camunda 8 skeleton
validates lazily via `requireProperty`/`validateConfigured` on first use — a known
inconsistency to align in a later story; do not copy that pattern.)

## Adapter id vs. adapter type — why two names

`vanillabp.adapters.<id>` configures an adapter *instance* of a *type*
(`getAdapters()` yields id → type). The same BPMS type may be configured twice with
different ids — the central migration scenario (e.g. old on-prem Camunda 8 cluster
and new SaaS cluster side by side, or two engine versions). Consequences:

- Never treat the adapter type as a singleton: **one `MigratableProcessService` AND
  one `AdapterDeploymentService` (and any BPMS client) per configured adapter id** —
  build them by iterating `properties.getAdapters()` for your type, not via
  `findFirst()`. (The current skeletons wrongly build a single process service from
  the first id — a rework story.)
- Adapter-specific configuration lives at `vanillabp.adapters.<id>.*` (the canonical
  location — `AdapterConfiguration`), NOT a parallel flat namespace. Scope-specific
  properties (per module/workflow/task, e.g. Camunda 8 job timeout) resolve
  most-specific-wins across four levels. See the `vanillabp-configuration-model`
  skill. (The dummy adapter's test-only `dummy-adapter.two-phase-commit` flag is a
  test toggle, not a template for real adapter config.)

## Release lines: versioning an adapter against its BPMS

Decided for Camunda 8, and the rule for every adapter facing a BPMS which ships
minors on a schedule.

**When a line is needed at all.** Only where the BPMS client the adapter compiles against
decides the lowest BPMS version a build accepts. Camunda documents its clients as compatible
with clusters of their own version and newer, and says nothing about the other direction, so
for Camunda 8 the client IS the minimum cluster version. The moment such an adapter uses
anything only the newest cluster has, every later bugfix in it is deliverable only together
with a cluster upgrade, which is what forces per-line builds. Where the engine is embedded
(Camunda 7) or sits behind an API of its own (Process-Engine-API), a fixed pin plus a
documented range in the README is the whole answer, and the platform gets the same treatment
against Spring Boot and Quarkus.

**Lines are build variants of ONE source tree, never maintenance branches.** A line is a
Maven profile selecting the BPMS client pin; the version is `${revision}`, resolved into the
published POMs by `flatten-maven-plugin`, so CI builds `2.1.0-8.8` and `2.1.0-8.9` from the
same commit. Every fix exists on every line the moment it is committed, and the version
number proves it is the same fix. With branches, each of the many changes that have nothing
to do with the BPMS would have to be cherry-picked, reviewed and released per line.

**The suffix rules.** `<adapter version>-<bpms minor>`, e.g. `2.1.0-8.9`, one artifactId. A
pre-release appends after the line, `2.2.0-8.10-alpha1`, because Maven sorts an unknown
qualifier like `preview1` ABOVE the release while `alpha1` sorts below it. artifactId
suffixes were rejected (moving a user across lines becomes a rename everywhere), classifiers
too (one POM per version, so lines cannot declare different dependencies).

**The delta rule.** `build-helper-maven-plugin` adds `src/main/java-line-<id>` and
`src/test/java-line-<id>`. Only two kinds of code belong there: code that cannot compile
against every supported client, and code that uses something only a newer BPMS has.
Everything else stays shared, which is the entire point. The line id reaches the runtime as a
filtered property in the adapter's version descriptor, and it is used in MESSAGES only:
behaviour follows what the BPMS answers, never what the build believes.

**The API identity rule.** The VanillaBP-facing API is IDENTICAL on every line, checked in CI
by dumping the public API of each line's JARs and diffing them. A user must never read a
version suffix to find out which methods exist. Where a line's BPMS cannot do something, the
same method is there and degrades with a guiding message naming the line, the way
`cancelUserTask` does on Camunda 8.

**The tripwire.** This scheme is chosen because the per-line delta is small. If the delta
grows past a handful of classes, or shared code stops compiling on a line in a way a small
shim cannot bridge, the scheme has become a branch scheme in disguise and the line is to be
split off deliberately as a maintenance branch. Write that sentence into the adapter's
README: whoever hits the limit will not be the person who chose the scheme.

**What may be called supported.** Only the BPMS versions the CI actually runs. A newer one is
"not tested", not "not supported". Per line, the integration tests run against that line's
pinned BPMS image, taken from the pin rather than written into the tests, and the full matrix
runs nightly while a pull request runs the current GA line alone.

**Renovate.** Inside a line, updates behave as usual. A client bump across a line boundary
gets its own branch and label plus `dependencyDashboardApproval`, so it stands as a reminder
that a BPMS and its applications move together and never merges itself. For consumers the
adapter ships a shareable preset using regex versioning with the `compatibility` capture
group, which Renovate never changes, so a consumer of `-8.8` is not offered `-8.9`. Plain
maven versioning cannot do this: it sorts `2.2.0-8.8` above `2.1.0-8.9`.

**How long a line lives.** A GA line lives until the next minor goes GA, so two GA lines at a
time plus a published pre-release line against the alpha of the next minor. That is policy,
not a technical limit, and the README says so next to the table.

## What you must never assume

Written from the code, and every line is a mistake an adapter has made or nearly made.

**About threads**

- Phase two runs on the store's dispatcher thread: no request scope, no security context, no
  MDC of the caller (the core sets its own), no thread-bound activation. Whatever phase two
  needs travels in the `PhaseTwoCall` args, which is why the activation id is an argument of
  the seven-argument `correlateMessagePhaseTwo` rather than something to read off the thread.
- Your inbound threads are yours, and their number is your decision to make and to bound.
  Camunda 8 runs four platform threads by default because one blocking handler stopped that
  adapter from polling at all, and because every running handler holds a database connection.
- `stopWorkflowProcessing` races the handlers which are still inside the application. Decide
  the policy and write it down: Camunda 8 waits for its handlers AND for the cluster to
  release the workers, and reports no job as failed while the shutdown runs.
- The core may call your probes from any application thread and from the dispatcher at the
  same time.

**About deliveries**

- Every delivery may come again, after a crash, after a lock timeout, or because your
  completion command failed after the commit. The core answers a repeated delivery from its
  record ONLY where you report a stable `getDeliveryId()`; without one the handler runs again
  and the application's own idempotency is the only net. Camunda 7 accepts exactly that,
  because its delivery is transactional.
- Two deliveries of one task at the same moment both run. Your BPMS' lock is the only thing
  which prevents it.
- A phase-two call may arrive twice, may arrive for a task which is gone, and - for
  everything but a start and a signal - may arrive after the workflow moved to another
  adapter. Answer honestly; the core re-probes.
- A rebuilt BPMS which restarts its key range makes old delivery records answer new
  deliveries. Document the operational step for your BPMS.

**About ordering**

- Outbox entries have no order: a push and a completion scheduled in one transaction may
  reach you in either order.
- Phase two of a start may run before or after the first inbound delivery of that workflow
  arrives, possibly on another node.
- A correlation may be published before the subscription exists. Do not treat "no
  subscription" as an error unless your BPMS does.
- Startup order: `deployResources` of every adapter of a module completes before any
  `startWorkflowProcessing` runs; extensions stop first, adapters last.

## The checklist before a pull request

1. One object per adapter id, configuration under `vanillabp.adapters.<id>.*`, validated at
   startup with guiding messages.
2. The pipeline in order: `readBpmn` → `prepareBpmn` (rewrite once per FILE) → `wireBpmn`
   (the wiring calls of `WorkflowTaskWiring`) → `deployResources` (ending with
   `registerDeployedVersion` per process - the two module-level checks are the core's) →
   `start`/`stopWorkflowProcessing`.
3. Phase one asks, phase two acts - for every operation, idempotently, throwing on anything
   but "gone". There is no switch which would let phase one act, whatever your BPMS is.
4. Probes scoped, never advancing, `UNKNOWN_TO_BPMS` and `BPMS_UNAVAILABLE` mapped honestly,
   the redispatch probe never optimistic, a visibility delay reported where your reads lag, and
   `canLocateWorkflows()` answered `false` where your BPMS cannot be asked about a workflow at all -
   the core then refuses to boot your adapter next to a second one instead of routing by list order.
5. Inbound contexts carry delivery id, activation id, adapter id and version; act on the
   outcome; never report a task as completed after an exception.
6. Classify permanent phase-two failures narrowly, write your shutdown policy down, bound
   your threads.
7. `GAPS.md` respectively the Deviations page says honestly what your BPMS cannot do, and
   deployment throws where a missing capability would produce a workflow without an
   aggregate.

## Testing

- Core logic: plain JUnit 5 + Mockito in `core`.
- Spring: integration tests booting a real context (see
  `spring-boot-integration/integration-tests/*` for style); no real BPMS needed for
  skeleton tests — assert the context boots with the adapter configured and the
  adapter type/id is resolved.
- Quarkus: `QuarkusExtensionTest` in the deployment module (style:
  `quarkus-integration/integration-tests/*` and the dummy adapter's deployment
  tests). Suppress build logs via `SuppressOutputExtension` from
  `test-utils`.
- Real-BPMS tests: Camunda 7 runs embedded (H2) → real engine in tests is cheap.
  Camunda 8 tests use `io.camunda:camunda-process-test-java` (Testcontainers-based,
  needs Docker). PEA tests run against the in-memory mock module.

## Documentation conventions

- **The adapter's WIKI is user-facing, its `README.md` is contributor-facing**
  — the opposite of Version 1.
- An adapter wiki carries exactly two kinds of content: **configuration**
  (dependencies, minimal configuration, the adapter's keys, and what the BPMN model
  has to look like for that BPMS, including what of the workflow aggregate reaches
  it) and **deviations** (one sentence per gap between the BPMS and VanillaBP's
  platform-wide contract, plus an outlook where there is one, each linking the
  README section carrying the full explanation). Behavior which holds on every
  adapter belongs in the main wiki once; rationale, alternatives considered and SPI
  mechanics belong in the README.
- A deliberate, fully-conforming adapter mode is NOT a deviation (e.g. Camunda 7's
  own-datasource two-phase commit) — document it with the configuration enabling it.
- Module `README.md` files are contributor documentation (concepts, design
  decisions) — same rule as in adapter-platform-integration.
- The PEA adapter additionally maintains `GAPS.md`: features that cannot be
  implemented via the Process-Engine-API (or need PEA/VanillaBP extensions), found
  during mock-first development.
